This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory with the following variables:

```env
# Vercel Blob Storage (optional but recommended for production)
BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN=your_vercel_blob_token_here

# Database
DATABASE_URL=your_database_connection_string
```

### Setting up Vercel Blob Storage

1. Go to your Vercel project dashboard
2. Navigate to the "Storage" tab
3. Create a new Blob storage
4. Copy the "Read/Write Token"
5. Add it as `BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN` in your environment variables

When `BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN` is not configured, images will be stored as base64 data URLs (suitable for development).
